# get_next_line - @42Born2Code

A C function that reads any valid file line by line until the end.

### What is get_next_line?

get_next_line is an individual project at 42 that basically reads a file line by line.

### Why would I use/try it?

You probably will never have to use this function if you are not a 42 student. The goal is to get better at C. As I said above, you can only use those three standard library functions:

* read
* malloc
* free

After finishing this project, you'll definitely learn some more about static variables, pointers, arrays, linked lists (if you decide to do the bonus part), dynamic memory allocation and file manipulation.

My code is not the best, but it passed all the 42 tests successfully.
